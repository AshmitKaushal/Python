    "'''Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python: \n",
    "In programming languages, mainly there are two approaches that are used to write program or code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1). Procedural Programming\n",
    "2). Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "The procedure we are following till now is the “Procedural Programming” approach. \n",
    "So, in this session, we will learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP). \n",
    "The basic idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is to use classes and objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# class\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
    "It defines the properties and methods that an object of that class will have. \n",
    "Properties are the data or state of an object, and methods are the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Object\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods. \n",
    "For example, you could create a class called \"Person\" that has properties such as name and age, \n",
    "and methods such as speak() and walk(). \n",
    "Each instance of the Person class would be a unique object with its own name and age, but they would all have the same methods to speak and walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "One of the key features of OOP in Python is encapsulation, \n",
    "which means that the internal state of an object is hidden and \n",
    "can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods. This helps to protect the object's data \n",
    "and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance\n",
    "Another key feature of OOP in Python is inheritance,\n",
    "which allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. \n",
    "This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality to existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism is also supported in Python, \n",
    "which means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class. \n",
    "This allows for greater flexibility in code and makes it easier to write code that can work with multiple types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, OOP in Python allows developers to model real-world concepts and entities using classes and objects, \n",
    "encapsulate data, reuse code through inheritance, and write more flexible code through polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. \n",
    "It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts defined above : \n",
    "\n",

    "what is object oriented programming in python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects and data rather than actions and logic. In Python, OOP is a fundamental concept that allows you to create classes and objects, encapsulate data and behavior, and build modular and reusable code. Here are the key components of object-oriented programming in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes:\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
    "It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.\n",
    "Classes are defined using the class keyword followed by the class name, and \n",
    "they typically have an __init__ method (constructor) for initializing object attributes.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects:\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. \n",
    "It represents a specific entity with its own unique data and behavior based on the class's blueprint.\n",
    "Objects are created using the class name followed by parentheses (ClassName()). \n",
    "Each object has its own set of attributes and methods defined by the class.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person2 = Person(\"Bob\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "Attributes are variables that belong to an object. They hold data associated with the object's state.\n",
    "Attributes are accessed using dot notation (object.attribute_name) and can be public, protected, or private based on naming conventions (_attribute for protected, __attribute for private).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(person2.age)   # Output: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "Methods are functions defined inside a class that perform operations on the object's data.\n",
    "They can take arguments like regular functions (self refers to the current object) and can modify the object's state or return values.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "print(person1.greet())  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass or base class).\n",
    "It promotes code reuse and hierarchy among classes, where subclasses can add new functionality or override existing methods.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name, age)\n",
    "        self.student_id = student_id\n",
    "\n",
    "    def study(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} is studying.\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class).\n",
    "It allows for data hiding, where internal details of an object are hidden from outside code, and only the interface (public methods) is accessible.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self.account_number = account_number\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "        \n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their superclass, enabling flexibility and code reuse.\n",
    "It includes method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass) and method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
    "Example (method overriding):\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def make_sound(animal):\n",
    "    print(animal.speak())\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "make_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "make_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "In Python, OOP promotes code organization, modularity, and abstraction, making it easier to manage and maintain complex systems. It emphasizes concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to create scalable and reusable code structures.\n",

    "# Object-oriented programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it a popular paradigm for software development. Here are some reasons why OOP is widely used and why there is a need for it:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Modularity:\n",
    "# OOP allows you to break  down complex systems into smaller,\n",
    "# more manageable modules called classes. Each class encapsulates data (attributes) and functionality (methods), \n",
    "# promoting modularity and organization in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Code Reusability:\n",
    "# OOP promotes code reuse through inheritance. \n",
    "# You can create new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (superclasses). \n",
    "# This saves development time and effort by avoiding redundant code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Encapsulation:\n",
    "# Encapsulation bundles data and methods within a class, hiding internal details and exposing a clean interface. \n",
    "# This helps in achieving data hiding, abstraction, and separation of concerns, making code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Abstraction:\n",
    "# Abstraction allows you to focus on essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. \n",
    "# By defining abstract classes and interfaces, OOP enables high-level modeling and reduces complexity, enhancing code readability and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.Polymorphism:\n",
    "# OOP supports polymorphism, where objects can be treated as instances of their superclass. \n",
    "# This enables flexibility in code design, as different objects can respond differently to the same method call, promoting code reuse and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.Ease of Maintenance:\n",
    "# OOP principles like encapsulation, modularity, \n",
    "# and inheritance contribute to cleaner code architecture,\n",
    "# reducing the likelihood of bugs and facilitating code maintenance and updates. \n",
    "# Changes made to one part of the codebase (e.g., modifying a class method) have minimal impact on other parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.Scalability:\n",
    "# OOP facilitates building scalable applications by structuring code in a hierarchical and organized manner. \n",
    "# As projects grow in complexity, OOP allows for easier management of codebases, team collaboration, and extension of functionality without compromising stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8.Real-world Modeling:\n",
    "# OOP aligns well with real-world modeling, where objects in software represent entities, concepts, or processes in the real world. \n",
    "# This makes OOP intuitive and suitable for domains such as simulations, games, GUI development, and business applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overall, OOP promotes better code organization, reusability, maintainability, and scalability, making it a valuable paradigm for developing robust and efficient software systems."

    "\n",
    "In Python, the concept of inheritance allows a subclass (derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from its superclass (base class). When you access an attribute or method on an instance of a class, Python uses the method resolution order (MRO) to determine which attribute or method to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
    "When you access an attribute or method on an object (obj.attr or obj.method()), Python first looks for it in the object's own __dict__ (obj.__dict__).\n",
    "If the attribute or method is not found in the object's __dict__, Python looks for it in the class hierarchy according to the MRO.\n",
    "The MRO defines the order in which Python searches for attributes and methods in the class hierarchy. It follows the C3 linearization algorithm to determine this order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance and Attribute/Method Lookup:\n",
    "When you define a class, Python creates a namespace for that class (MyClass.__dict__) to store its attributes and methods.\n",
    "If a class inherits from anotr class, Python follows the MRO to resolve attribute and method loohekup.\n",
    "If an attribute or method is not found in the subclass's __dict__, Python looks for it in the superclass's __dict__, and so on up the inheritance chain.\n",
    "Now, regarding class attributes/methods not being directly stored in an instance's __dict__:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Attributes/Methods:\n",
    "Class attributes and methods are stored in the class's namespace (MyClass.__dict__) and are shared among all instances of the class.\n",
    "When you access a class attribute/method through an instance (obj.attr or obj.method()), Python first checks the instance's __dict__. If the attribute/method is not found there, Python then looks in the class's __dict__ and follows the MRO.\n",
    "\n",
