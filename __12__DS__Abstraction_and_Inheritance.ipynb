    "# 1.Define Common Interfaces:\n",
    "# The abc module helps define a common interface for a group of classes, ensuring that they implement the required methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Enforce Method Implementation:\n",
    "# It enforces that subclasses must implement specific methods, providing structure and consistency to your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Improve Code Quality:\n",
    "# By using abstract base classes, you can catch errors early if subclasses fail to implement the necessary methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Polymorphism:\n",
    "# Abstract classes enable polymorphism by ensuring that different subclasses implement the same set of methods, allowing you to work with objects of different types in a uniform way.\n",

    "# Summary of abc Module:\n",
    "# ABC: A class that is inherited by abstract base classes.\n",

    "# Encapsulation in Python refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit, typically a class, and controlling access to this data to ensure better modularity and protection. It is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1.Data Hiding:\n",
    "# Encapsulation allows restricting direct access to some of an object's components.\n",
    "# In Python, this is achieved using access modifiers (public, protected, and private attributes).\n",
    "# By hiding the internal implementation details, encapsulation ensures that an object’s data is accessed and modified in a controlled manner.\n",

    "# This allows validation and safeguards against invalid updates.\n",

    "# 3.Modularity:\n",
    "# Encapsulation helps keep related data and methods together in a single class, making the code more modular, maintainable, and reusable."
